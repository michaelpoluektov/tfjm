# Policemen with drones

My solution to problem number 6 of TFJM 2020, a French contest in research mathematics.

The competition required us to solve at least 4 problems in a team of up to six (to the best of our abilities). Our team had 5 members, each working on a separate problem. I have been working on problem number 6, you can find the (automatically) translated version of the problem below:

Winston is a Police Commissioner. He seeks to capture a thief with the help of his new ones drones.
The city where Winston works is made up of neighborhoods, and some neighborhoods are connected between them by two-way roads. Winston has an unlimited number of drones and n
police.
One day at midnight, a thief appears in a part of town, but Winston doesn't know which one.
- Each morning he chooses as many quarters as he wants, in which he sends a drone.
- At noon, his watch rings if one of his drones has been sent to the neighborhood where the thief. However, he doesn't know which of his drones detected the thief.
- In the afternoon, Winston can send his agents to up to n quarters. However, for to do this he must be certain that at least one of his agents will come to the neighborhood where the thief is hiding to stop him. If Winston can't stop the thief with certainty he does not send his agents.
- Finally, every night except the first, the thief moves through a neighborhood following a road.

We first assume that the thief cannot stay in the same neighborhood two consecutive days.

The problem is split into multiple questions which can be found in the solution PDF.
